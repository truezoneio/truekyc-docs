# Verifying Businesses

This guide walks you through the process of verifying a business profile on the platform, ensuring compliance with KYB regulations.

## Understanding the Business Profile Interface

The business profile interface includes the following tabs:
- **Verification**: Displays the business's details and documents.
- **Transactions**: Shows transaction history (available if the business is approved).
- **Notes**: Allows adding and viewing notes about the business.

## Reviewing the Verification Tab

In the **Verification** tab, you will find the business’s information and uploaded documents. Review these to ensure accuracy and compliance.

- **Business Information**: Displays fields such as the incorporation number, tax number, address, and country.
- **Documents**: Lists all uploaded documents like incorporation certificates. You can view these documents in PDF or image format.

## Starting the Verification Check

To begin the verification:
- Click **Start Check**.
- Review each document and piece of information, marking them as **Approved**, **Pending**, or **Rejected**.

### Handling Documents and Information

For each document and field:
- Approve the item if it meets the required standards.
- Mark as pending if further information is needed.
- Reject if the information is incorrect or insufficient.

### Submitting the Verification Decision

Once you’ve reviewed all items:
- Approve the business if everything is in order.
- Reject the business if it fails to meet verification standards.
- Request a resubmission if additional documents or information are required.

### Resubmission Process

If resubmission is necessary, specify which documents or fields need to be corrected. The business will be prompted to update their information.

### Managing the Verification Status

A business can have the following statuses:
- **Pending**: Verification is still in progress.
- **Approved**: The business has successfully passed verification.
- **Rejected**: The business has failed to meet the necessary requirements.
- **Resubmission**: The business needs to submit additional information.

## Finalizing the Verification

Once the verification is complete and the business has met all requirements, update the status to **Approved**. The business will now be able to proceed with transactions on the platform.
