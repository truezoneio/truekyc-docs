# Verifications

Verifications are a crucial part of compliance, ensuring that businesses and customers meet regulatory requirements such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business). This section provides guides on verifying customers and businesses, handling resubmissions, and managing verification statuses.

## Verification Types

The platform supports two main types of verifications:
1. **Customer Verifications** (KYC): Ensures that individuals meet the necessary identification requirements before they can use your platform.
2. **Business Verifications** (KYB): Verifies businesses to ensure their legitimacy and compliance with regulations.

## Customer Verification

Customer verification ensures that the personal details and documents submitted by individual customers are accurate and compliant. The verification process includes reviewing personal information, approving or rejecting documents, and managing statuses such as pending, approved, or rejected.

## Business Verification

Business verification involves validating the legitimacy of a company, reviewing its documentation, and ensuring it meets the necessary compliance standards. This process includes verifying incorporation documents, tax numbers, and additional business information.

## Remote Verifications

The platform supports remote verifications via dynamically generated QR links, allowing customers and businesses to complete their verification from anywhere. This is especially useful for onboarding remote users or businesses.
