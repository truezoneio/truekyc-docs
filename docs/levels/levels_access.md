## Accessing Levels in the Application

### Viewing Levels

To view existing levels, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Levels" section from the application menu.
2. Choose between KYC or KYB by selecting the corresponding tab.

Each level will be displayed in a table with information such as its name, fields, documents, and verification methods.

## Best Practices

1. **Name Levels Clearly**: Use descriptive names for levels to make it easier to identify them later.
2. **Choose Relevant Fields and Documents**: Only include fields and documents that are essential for the verification process.
3. **Use Appropriate Verification Methods**: Ensure the verification method suits the level's needs, whether SMS or email.
