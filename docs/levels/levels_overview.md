## Overview of Levels

Levels represent different stages or categories of information required for verification, whether for customers (KYC) or businesses (KYB). Each level can have custom fields, documents, and verification methods.

### KYC and KYB Levels

- **KYC Level**: Used to define customer-related verification fields, documents, and verification methods (e.g., email or SMS).
- **KYB Level**: Used to define business-related verification fields, required documents, and verification methods.

## Key Components of Level Management

1. **Name**: A name that you will use to identify each level when selecting.
2. **Fields**: Custom information fields that users must provide.
3. **Documents**: Types of documents that need to be uploaded (e.g., ID, proof of address).
4. **Verifications**: Methods to verify user or business identity, such as SMS or email verification.
