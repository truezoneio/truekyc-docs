# Transaction Monitoring

## Overview

Transaction Monitoring allows you to track and manage financial transactions in your platform. It ensures that transactions are compliant with regulations, providing oversight and risk mitigation for both customer and business transactions.

The Transaction Monitoring system is equipped with tools to filter, search, and analyze transactions. You can also create new transactions, verify details, and monitor the involvement of counterparties in different transaction types.

### Transaction Types

You can manage various transaction types, such as payments, transfers, and withdrawals. Each transaction type has its own specific set of fields that need to be filled out during the creation process.

### Counterparties

Transactions can involve external parties known as counterparties. When you process transfers, the system tracks the counterparty details such as their name, country, ID number, and account details.
