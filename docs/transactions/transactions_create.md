# Creating Transactions

## Overview

This guide explains how to create new transactions for verified customers and businesses. You'll learn how to select a customer or business, fill out transaction details, and manage counterparty information.

## Selecting Customer or Business

When creating a new transaction, you can select a verified customer or business. This ensures that only approved entities can process financial transactions on your platform.

Once you've selected a customer or business, the transaction form will appear.

## Transaction Details

Fill out the following fields for the transaction:
- **Date**: The date and time of the transaction.
- **Type**: Select the type of transaction (e.g., transfer, payment).
- **Amount**: Specify the transaction amount.
- **Currency**: Choose the currency for the transaction.
- **Account**: Enter the account details associated with the transaction.

### Counterparty Details

If the transaction type involves a counterparty (e.g., transfers), you will need to provide details such as:
- **Full Name**: The name of the counterparty.
- **ID Number**: The identification number of the counterparty.
- **Country**: The nationality of the counterparty.
- **Account**: The account details of the counterparty (e.g., bank account number).

Once all details are filled out, submit the form to create the transaction.
