# Creating Remote Verification Links

## Overview

Creating remote verification links allows businesses to send dynamic KYC (Know Your Customer) or KYB (Know Your Business) verification requests to their customers or business partners. These links initiate the verification process remotely, allowing users to submit required personal, business, and document details securely.

The links can be shared via email, and once clicked, the user will begin the KYC or KYB process by providing their information.

## Steps to Create a Remote Verification Link

### 1. Creating a KYC (Customer) Verification Link

1. **Navigate to the Customers Page:**
   - In your dashboard, click on the "Customers" tab to access the customer verification section.

2. **Click "Create New" Button:**
   - A button labeled **Create New** will appear at the top of the page. Clicking this will allow you to start creating a new KYC link or customer profile.

3. **Select the Verification Level:**
   - In the modal that appears, use the **Level Select Form** to choose the appropriate verification level for the customer. Each level may include different fields, required documents, and verifications (e.g., email or SMS verification).
   
4. **Generate the Link or Create a Customer:**
   - After selecting the level, you have two options:
     - **Create Link**: Generate a link that can be sent to the customer for self-verification. This will create a unique verification link (QR code or URL) that the customer can use to complete the KYC process.
     - **Create Customer**: Open a drawer where you can manually create a customer profile with all necessary details (first name, last name, phone, email, etc.).
   
5. **Send the Link to the Customer:**
   - If you chose to create a link, the system will generate a unique URL, and you can share this with the customer via email or another messaging service.
   - You will also receive a QR code that can be scanned for easy access to the link.

### 2. Creating a KYB (Business) Verification Link

1. **Navigate to the Businesses Page:**
   - In your dashboard, click on the "Businesses" tab to access the business verification section.

2. **Click "Create New" Button:**
   - A **Create New** button will be available at the top of the page. Clicking this will allow you to start creating a new KYB link or business profile.

3. **Select the Verification Level:**
   - In the modal that appears, use the **Level Select Form** to choose the appropriate verification level for the business. Different levels may include varying requirements, such as business incorporation documents, tax ID, or additional verifications.

4. **Generate the Link or Create a Business:**
   - After selecting the level, you can:
     - **Create Link**: This will generate a link that can be sent to the business for self-verification. A QR code or URL will be created that the business representative can use to provide the necessary information.
     - **Create Business**: Manually create a business profile by filling out business details (business name, incorporation number, tax number, etc.).

5. **Share the Link with the Business:**
   - If you chose to create a link, the platform will generate a unique URL or QR code, which can be shared with the business representative. They can use this link to complete the KYB process remotely.
