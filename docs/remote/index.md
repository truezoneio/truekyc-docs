# Remote Verification

## Overview

Remote Verification enables businesses to verify their customers and businesses without requiring physical presence. By using dynamic links for KYC (Know Your Customer) or KYB (Know Your Business) verification, users can provide necessary personal, business, and financial information securely from anywhere.

The process involves multiple steps, such as collecting personal or business details, verifying email and phone numbers, and uploading necessary documents.

Remote Verification is an essential tool for businesses aiming to streamline their compliance processes while providing flexibility to their customers and partners.

### Key Steps:
- **Personal Information**: Collect and verify customer information.
- **Company Information**: For businesses, gather company details such as incorporation number and tax ID.
- **Document Upload**: Ensure users upload required identity documents or business-related documentation.
- **SMS and Email Verification**: Verify phone numbers and email addresses for security purposes.
