## Accessing Customer Creation

Clicking the "Create New" button in the header of Customers page opens a modal where you can choose the customer level or create a link for remote verification.

## Selecting Customer Level

In the modal, select a level for the customer. Levels dictate the verification type and fields required for the customer.

## Filling Out Customer Information

Once a level is selected, the form will appear. Fill out the required customer fields, including personal information, phone number, and email.

### Handling Additional Fields

The fields are dynamically generated based on the customer level's specifications. You will also be required to upload documents as part of the KYC process.

## Document Upload and Verification

Customers may need to upload documents, depending on the verification level. These can be uploaded through the file inputs in the form.

### Verifications

Some customers may require phone or email verification. These are handled by SMS and Email verification modals.

## Completing the Customer Creation

After filling out all necessary fields and completing verifications, click submit to finalize the customer creation. If successful, the customer will be added to your company.

Once the customer is successfully created, you will see them listed in your customer data table.
