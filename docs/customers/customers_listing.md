# Listing Customers

This guide explains the process of listing and filtering customers in the KYC (Know Your Customer) platform. It covers how to display customer information, apply filters, and manage customer profiles.

## Overview

The customer listing system provides a way to view all customers registered in your platform. You can also apply filters to find specific customers based on various attributes like status, level, risk, and more.

## Displaying Customers

The Customers page is responsible for displaying the list of customers. It renders a data table that shows essential information about each customer, including their name, status, risk level, and more.

- **Customers Table**: The table displays columns like:
  - Customer Name
  - Status (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Approved, Rejected, Resubmission)
  - Tags (Labels that give detailed information about application status)
  - Risk (Low, Medium, High)
  - Level (Assigned verification level)
  - Date (Customer creation date)

- **Row Actions**: Clicking on a customer row will navigate you to the detailed profile of that customer.


## 2. Filtering Customers

The customers table provides multiple options for filtering the customers. You can filter based on:

- **Status**: Customer's verification status (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected).
- **Risk**: Customer's assigned risk level (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
- **Level**: KYC or KYB levels assigned to the customer.
- **Country**: The customer's nationality or country of origin.
- **Date**: Filter customers based on their registration date.


## 3. Customer Actions

You can perform different actions from the customer listing page:
- **View Profile**: Clicking on a customer row opens the customerâ€™s profile, where you can view details and manage verification.
- **Create New Customer**: From the listing page, you can click the "Create New" button to add a new customer to the system.
