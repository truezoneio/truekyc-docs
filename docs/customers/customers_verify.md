# Verifying Customers

This guide will walk you through the process of verifying customer profiles on your platform. Verifying customer information ensures compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations and helps maintain the integrity of your business operations.

Verifying customer profiles ensures your business remains compliant with regulatory requirements while building trust and credibility with your users. By carefully following the steps outlined above, you can efficiently manage and verify customer information and maintain a smooth onboarding process for your users.

### Understanding the Customer Profile Interface
The customer profile page contains the following sections:

- **Verification**: This tab displays the customer’s personal information and uploaded documents for verification.
- **Transactions** (available if the customer is approved): View a history of the customer’s transactions.
- **Notes**: Add or view notes related to the customer.

You can switch between these tabs to access the relevant information.

### Reviewing the Verification Tab
Once in the **Verification** tab, you'll see sections for personal information and documents:

- **Personal Information**: Displays fields such as ID number, name, nationality, date of birth, and more.
- **Documents**: Lists the customer’s uploaded documents, such as identification cards or proof of address. You can review these documents in PDF or image format by clicking on the corresponding files.

If all information appears to be correct and compliant, you can proceed with verifying the customer.

### Starting the Verification Check
- To begin verifying, click the **Start Check** button located at the top right corner of the **Verification** tab.
- You will now be able to mark the customer's information and documents as either **Approved**, **Pending**, or **Rejected**.

### Handling Documents and Information
For each document or piece of personal information:
- Mark them as **Approved** if they meet the required standards.
- Mark them as **Pending** if you need further clarification or additional documents.
- Mark them as **Rejected** if they do not meet the required standards or are incorrect.

### Submitting the Verification Decision
Once you’ve reviewed all the documents and personal information, you can finalize your verification decision:

- If everything is in order, click **Finish Check** to approve the customer.
- If there are issues, click **Reject** and provide the relevant tags or reasons for rejection.
- If additional documents or information are required, mark the customer for **Resubmission**. This will prompt the customer to provide the missing information or correct the errors.

### Resubmission Process
If the customer needs to submit new information, follow these steps:
- Click on the **Resubmission** button, where you will specify which documents or information need to be resubmitted.
- You can choose to flag personal information or specific documents for resubmission.

Once the customer provides the required information, you will be notified to re-check the profile.

### Managing the Verification Status
The verification status will automatically update based on your actions:
- **Pending**: The customer is awaiting review or has incomplete documents.
- **Approved**: The customer has passed verification successfully.
- **Rejected**: The customer has not met the verification requirements.
- **Resubmission**: The customer needs to provide further details or correct errors.

### Finalizing the Verification
After completing the verification process, ensure the status is updated to reflect the customer’s current standing. Approved customers can proceed with transactions on your platform, while rejected or pending customers will need to resolve their issues before moving forward.
