# Getting Started

Welcome to TrueKYC! This guide provides a quick overview of the core sections in the platform and how to navigate them. For more detailed information on each topic, follow the provided links.

## Navigating Dashboard

The **Dashboard** is the main page you see after logging in. It provides a summary of your account, including recent verifications, transactions, and any pending actions. From the dashboard, you can quickly navigate to other sections like Levels, Verifications, and Transactions to manage your KYC/KYB processes.

## Creating Levels

**Levels** are the building blocks of the verification process. They define the stages customers or businesses need to go through during verification, including what information to collect and which documents to request. 

Setting up levels is essential before you can start verifying customers or businesses.

## Verifications

Verifications refer to the process of validating customer (KYC) or business (KYB) data. There are two types of verifications in TrueKYC:
- **KYC**: For individual customers, ensuring their identity is verified.
- **KYB**: For businesses, verifying that the business and its representatives are legitimate.

## Transactions

Once a customer or business has been verified, you can create and monitor **Transactions**. Transactions help track activities and ensure that all necessary information and counterparties are recorded for compliance purposes.

## Remote Links

In some cases, you may need to send a remote verification link to a customer or business, allowing them to complete the verification process on their own. Remote links make it easy to onboard customers or businesses without requiring in-person interactions.
