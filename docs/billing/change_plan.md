# Changing Plans

If your business grows or your requirements change, you can easily upgrade or downgrade your subscription plan.

## How to Change Your Plan

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page.
2. Click **Manage Subscription**.
3. You will be redirected to the Stripe customer portal, where you can select a different plan.

All changes to your subscription will be reflected immediately, and any prorated adjustments will be handled through Stripe.

{: .note}
You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time, but downgrades will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle.
