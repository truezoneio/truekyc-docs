# Canceling Your Plan

If you need to cancel your subscription, you can easily do so through the billing section.

## How to Cancel

1. Go to the **Billing** page and click **Manage Subscription**.
2. You will be redirected to the Stripe customer portal, where you can choose to cancel your subscription.

Once canceled, your subscription will remain active until the end of the billing period, after which your account will be downgraded to the free tier or deactivated if no free tier is available.

{: .warning}
If you cancel your subscription, any ongoing services, including KYC and KYB verifications, will stop once your billing cycle ends.
