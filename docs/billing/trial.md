# Free Trials

TrueKYC offers a 7-day free trial for new customers. During this period, users can explore the platform's features, including KYC, KYB, and transaction monitoring, without any charges.

### Trial Limits

During the trial, there may be limits on certain actions (e.g., the number of KYC verifications). These limits are clearly indicated in your account dashboard.

At the end of the trial, users will be redirected to the Stripe customer portal to select a subscription plan if they wish to continue using TrueKYC. No charges will be incurred unless a paid plan is selected.

Make sure to upgrade your plan before the trial ends to avoid any service interruptions.
